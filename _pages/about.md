I am a fourth year Computer Science Ph.D. student at Oregon State University. I am co-advised by Prof. Raviv Raich and Prof. Jinsub Kim. My focus is in adversarial machine learning, with an emphasis in developing cost-aware countermeasures for test-time adversarial attacks. I have also published work on hyperspectral unmixing.
